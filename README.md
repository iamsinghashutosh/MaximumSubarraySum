# MaximumSubarraySum
It Includes the kedane algorithm and the more optimised dynamic programming method to find the maximum subarray sum.
Both the programs are in cpp language.
Kedane algorithm only fails in the case when all the array elements are negative.
The second program using dp can be used in all cases with time complexity O(n).
